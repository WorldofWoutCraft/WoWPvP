# WoWPvP

WoWPvP is a bukkit plugin project aimed at three simple objectives:

  - Creating a nice PvP plugin
  - Creating a framework I can use for other arena styled plugins
  - Getting better at OO design

If you want to help me with my design, or see an improvement somewhere, please let me know. That's another objective I always have. To learn.
